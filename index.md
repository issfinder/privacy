# ISS Finder privacy policy statement

*Last updated: February 2026*

ISSFinder is designed with your privacy in mind. This statement explains what data the app accesses, how it is used, and what is shared.

## Location Data

ISSFinder requests your device location to calculate pass predictions and display your position on the map. Your coordinates are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to any server operated by ISSFinder. A reverse-geocode request is sent to OpenStreetMap Nominatim to resolve your city name — this request contains only coordinates, no personal identifiers.

## Network Requests

The app connects to the following third-party services:

- CelesTrak — satellite orbital data (TLE)
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim — reverse geocoding
- CARTO / OpenStreetMap — map tiles
- GitHub (corquaid ISS API) — crew information
- YouTube / NASA — live streaming feeds
- Open-Meteo — cloud cover forecasts

No personal data is included in any of these requests.

## Crash Reporting

ISSFinder uses Sentry to collect anonymous crash reports and diagnostics. These reports may include device type, OS version, app version, and stack traces. No personal data, location, or browsing history is included.

## Local Storage

App settings (theme, time format, window position) and cached data (TLE, crew information, weather forecasts) are stored locally using Windows application storage. No data is synced to the cloud.

## Data Sharing

ISSFinder does not sell, share, or transfer your data to any third party for advertising or tracking purposes.
